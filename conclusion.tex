Based on the performed research, this thesis did not show any general influence of the
inter-domain regions' composition on the function, activity, or specificity of human
two-domain PKs.
The insufficiently sized dataset together with the incompleteness and uninformativeness
of the GO terms and EC numbers contributed to the negative result.

However, considering the limitations discussed above, a correlation between the averaged
linker region's properties and the PK activity cannot be excluded yet.
The elucidation of the effect of the linkers' composition on protein activity could
improve our ability to predict the function of multi-domain proteins, but further
research is needed to disclose the presented problem.
The drafted strategy applied in this thesis could be improved in future work by taking
into account more two-domain PKs, and by implementing similarity measures of GO terms to
condensate akin vocables, hence reducing the immensely detailed nature of the GO database.
Yet, success cannot be guaranteed.
